                <div class="info-sale__text">After placing an order, you will receive an order receipt confirmation
                    email from us acknowledging that we have received your order.
                    After receiving your payment, we will send a payment receipt email notifying the receipt of your
                    payments with the title “BITMAIN Order Paid”. We reserve the right to cancel your order if we fail
                    to receive your payments in the period designated by us.
                    Please note that these emails do not mean that your order has been accepted or confirmed. Your order
                    constitutes an offer to us to buy a product.
                    All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending
                    you a shipping confirmation email confirming the shipment of your order with the title “BITMAIN
                    Order Shipped”.
                    You can review the status of your Order anytime by accessing your user Account created the first
                    time you place an order on our Site.
                    Your order will only be accepted by us and a contract will only be formed with us when we send you
                    the shipping confirmation. The contract will relate only to those products whose shipment we have
                    confirmed in the shipping confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other products which
                    may have been part of your order but are not included in the shipping confirmation. We reserve the
                    right to cancel your order at any time before we have accepted the order and shipped the products
                    and we may rescind our acceptance and cancel your order where:
                    (1) there has been an obvious error in price;
                    (2) the product probably cannot be shipped to the designated address due to the change of custom’s
                    policy or import control of certain country or other Force Majeure event; or
                    (3) the product is no longer in our or our third party fulfillment provider's inventory.
                    Please do not place your order with anyone or anybody claiming to be an official representative of
                    us over email or Skype or any web site other than the Site. It can be a scam and your confirmed
                    order may never be delivered in such cases. We are not bound by such order, we will not be
                    responsible to offer any kind of compensation in such cases, and we will not be liable for any and
                    all losses or damages arising out of such cases.</div>

                <div class="info-sale__text">Prices and availability of products on the Site are subject to change
                    without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered. Despite our best efforts, the products
                    listed on our Site may be outdated. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch
                    procedures so that, where a product's current price is less than our stated price, we will charge
                    the lower amount when dispatching the product to you. If a product's current price is higher than
                    the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for
                    instructions before dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.
                    We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at the outdated (lower) price, even after
                    we have sent you an Order Receipt Confirmation or Payment Receipt, if the pricing error could have
                    reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error. Prices of products on the Site are fixed in a
                    USD value. The payments for Orders are accepted in US Dollars.
                    On occasion, you may be able to place a product in your shopping cart and submit your order for
                    processing, but your order is subsequently canceled due to the unavailability of product. You
                    acknowledge that products may be sold quickly and there may be a short time gap after an order has
                    been submitted, but where the product is no longer available. You agree that we may cancel your
                    order after you have received an Order Receipt Confirmation or a Payment Receipt without penalty. On
                    very rare occasions, you may receive a Shipping Confirmation from us, but the product is no longer
                    available in our or our third party fulfillment provider's inventory. You agree that we may rescind
                    our acceptance and cancel your order without penalty if we are unable to ship the product you
                    ordered due to unavailability.
                    All purchases are final. On rare occasions we may, at its sole discretion, make an exception. Such
                    exceptions are made on a one time only basis and do not obligate us in any way whatsoever in
                    subsequent cases.
                    You consent to receive sales invoices electronically. Electronic invoices will be made available in
                    the user Profile area of the Site.</div>
